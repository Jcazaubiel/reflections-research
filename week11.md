BioViz: An Interactive Visualization Engine for the Design of Digital Microfluidic Biochips

I chose this article because it is about the creation of a visualization tool for a field that previously didn't have any. The researchers developed a tool to allow other researchers that work on microfluidic biochips to visualize what their designs would result in. From the article, they usually have to rely on console outputs, which is not really efficient or easy to use/visualize. 

The paper does not really delve deep into the technicalities of the tool, but instead explains the rationale behind their design choices. They chose to develop a language for the tool that is very user centric: it had to be simple to use and to read, and be useable not only in very specific situations. Instead, they chose to make it as general as possible, so that it had a wide range of applications. They also allow for customization of the language, so that users can define their own functionalities very easily if they need to.

Focusing on the design of the tool, it is fairly simple. They have squares with different colors and icons that signify different things. While this may be a simple visualization, this is a huge step forward for a field that relies on console outputs. They included different display choices that they thought would benefit reserchers.

Overall, I think that this is a great example of visualization being useful before it is pretty. They created a tool that is useful to other researchers and is designed to make their work easier, and even if it is not the prettiest visualization around it is still better than what was there before. As time passes, otehr functionalities and cosmetic improvements might be made, and it could catch up to more refined tools.
