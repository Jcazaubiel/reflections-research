As a BCB major, I'm interesting in visualizations applied to biology, or biological problems. I found the article above, describing a few relatively recent advances in biovisualizations. The article describes 5 visualizations that were presented at a conference.

We start with a visualization of cellular paths. Before, all paths were visualized in 3D, resulting in a big ball that was very hard to make sense out of. The researcher then decided to follow fluid mechanics rule to treat the movements like currents, and developed a model that only show the main currents in the cell. This made it much easier to get an understanding of what was going on.

The next one is actually inspired by Picasso, and it comes down to visualizing the organization of an egg not only as a 3D model, but also as a graph. This graph can then be used to explore which configurations are most popular and how they impact development. 

The paper then presents an innovative model of a cell, which we already talked about in class, and two other visualizations: a 3D model of a cell that is customizable via rules, and an image processing program that can be used to automate modeling and classification of different biological objects (insect wings, fossils).

Overall, this article shows that visualization can be highly customizable, depending on which field it is used for. Different ideas can be drawn from and used for many different fields, we just need to make a connection.
