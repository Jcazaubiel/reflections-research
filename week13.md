PresentaBALL â€” A powerful package for presentations and lessons in structural biology

As someone who has had to learn about molecular biology and chemistry, a lot of times being able to see the structure of molecules of interest has been a great help in understanding difficult concepts. A good example of that is in organic chemistry, when we were encouraged to use modelling kits to build molecules to understand conformations and chemical reactions.

This paper introduces a tool to help with structural biology lessons, by offering an interface with customizable visualizations and informative texts/videos that can be integrated. Overall, the aim of this study was to design this tool as a proof of concept for a tool that is accessible to as many users as possible, and gather feedback for improvements. Indeed, a lot of biovisualization tools aimed at experts are not really suited for teaching, and it is important to make more accessible tools without sacrificing functionality.

The authors start by listing all the requirements that an easy to use, educational, and functional tool would need to meet. This includes powerful modeling capabilities and support of commonly used file formats, along with presentation interfaces that allow for an effective visualization of models along with the integration of educative contents. In order to integrate all these requirements, they created an app that communicates with a web page. This allows easy use of the program through a web browser without sacrificing performance. 

In order to gather feedback, students and teachers actually used the program and were asked to provide their opinion on the project, and their learning progress was monitored. It turns out that students were able to navigate the lesson plans easily and in a third of the usual time taken to learn these concepts. Their feedback was taken into account, but it was overall very encouraging and supported the idea that such a tool could support structural biology learning.
