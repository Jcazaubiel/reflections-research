A BIM-based visualization and warning system for fire rescue

I chose this paper because it applies visualization to a problem that is fairly widespread - fires. In the paper, the authors create a system that uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) to create a tool for firefighters to use before going in, along with a real time Internet of things tool that helps reassess the situation and assist people leaving the building. 

I like this paper because it takes visualization tools and information from sensors and creates a simulation that is updated in real time. They show models of what the finished product is supposed to look like, and they use relatively simple visual cues (color gradients) to convey things like temperature, smoke, or CO2 levels. I also like that they thought not only of the responders using the building model, but also of the people escaping. Laser pointers/projectors are linked to the model and the sensors in the building, and they can change the image they project based on the real time information they receive. In order to convey simple messages, they use very clear yet simple icons: arrows to tell people to turn left or right, a cross to prevent people from opening doors that lead to more danger, or a circle to say it's okay to continue.

Overall, this application of many different tools and visualizations has a lot of potential to help people survive and stop fires more efficiently
